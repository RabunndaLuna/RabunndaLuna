### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Jennifer Pichardo (pronouns: they/them) and I'm an aspiring game developer currently studying Game Design and Development at Rochester Institute of Technology.

I enjoy working alongside others to help develop creative and fun projects. I'm familiar with languages such as C#, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have worked with Unity Game Engine, Unreal Game Engine, and Visual Studio.


In my spare time, I draw digital illustrations, both original character design and fanart, posting them on my social media.


Feel free to look at my pinned repositories for examples of projects I worked on. Thank you!
