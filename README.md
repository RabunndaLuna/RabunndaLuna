Hello! I'm Jennifer Pichardo and I'm an aspiring game developer currently studying Game Design and Development at Rochester Institute of Technology.
I'm currently looking for an internship/co-op in software design and development where I can challenge and improve upon my creative and technical skills.

I enjoy working alongside others to help develop creative and fun projects. I'm familiar with languages such as C#, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have worked with Unity Game Engine, a bit of Unreal Game Engine, and Visual Studio.


In my spare time, I draw digital illustrations, both original character design and fanart, posting them on my social media.
